So far I have put together a very simple server that can take Get requests. 
I have also put together a rigid skeleton of my user interface but I have inserted 
and greatly modified an event calendar that is a major part of the project. 
I still need to create functionality between the calendar and the server and create a database. 
I will be able to make these things happen in the next couple weeks.
