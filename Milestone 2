Sorry it's late, but I have been working tirelessly on it. It might not look like
I've progressed much in the past week, but I have. I found that the old calendar I was
using was not fitting the mold I needed so I did an entire switch over to the JQuery
Frontier Calendar. Which was hard because I was getting the hang of FullCalendar. But
the switch provided functionality that I needed. I have successfully implemented Riak
on my machine and have figured out how to work it with node.js, so I can start using it.
The hold up I'm having currently is with Ajax and JSON. Whenever I pass JSON to the server
using Ajax, the JSON data becomes circular and unable to be used at all. I've tried looking
into a few things but I haven't been able to figure out how to get the communication
between my client, server and database working. That all depends on Ajax and JSON. Once
I get that figured out though I should be good to finish up all I can before I have to 
turn it in.
